# Bubble Sort

- Bubble Sort is the elementary sorting algorithm for sorting various data structures. It is a comparison-based sorting algorithm in which each element is compared with the next element, and is swapped if those elements are not in the correct order.

- The algorithm starts with comparing the first pair of elements.
- If the first element is smaller than the second element, then the elements are swapped
- This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets
