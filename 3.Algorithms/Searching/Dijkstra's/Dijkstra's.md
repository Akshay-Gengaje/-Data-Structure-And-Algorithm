Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular shortest-path algorithm used in graph theory. It is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, with positive edge weights.

The algorithm works by maintaining a set of visited nodes and a set of unvisited nodes. Initially, all nodes are unvisited, except for the starting node. The distance to the starting node is set to zero, and the distance to all other nodes is set to infinity.

At each iteration, the algorithm selects the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the starting node and adds it to the visited set. The algorithm then updates the distances of all the unvisited nodes adjacent to the newly visited node, if the distance through the newly visited node is shorter than their current distance. This process is repeated until the destination node is reached, or until there are no more unvisited nodes.

The algorithm maintains a data structure called a priority queue to efficiently select the node with the smallest distance. The priority queue is implemented using a heap data structure.

Dijkstra's algorithm guarantees that the shortest path to each node is found in order, so the algorithm can be stopped as soon as the destination node is visited. The algorithm can also be used to find the shortest path between a starting node and all other nodes in the graph.

Dijkstra's algorithm has a time complexity of O(E+VlogV), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph. The algorithm is efficient for small to medium-sized graphs but can become slow for larger graphs.
