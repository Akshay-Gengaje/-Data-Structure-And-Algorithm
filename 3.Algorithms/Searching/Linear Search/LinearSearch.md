# Linear Search

Linear search is a simple search algorithm that works by sequentially checking each element in a list until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached. It is also known as sequential search.

Linear Search is a sequential search algorithm. - In Linear Search, weâ€™ll have to traverse the array comparing the elements consecutively one after the other
Until the target value is found. - Linear Search has a high time complexity making at most n comparison - Hence, it is only suitable to search for elements in a small and unsorted list of elements

### Algorithm to implement linear search

- Take input from the user for both the array & item to be searched.
- Using a sequential loop compare each element in the array with the item.
- If at any index both matches, terminate and print found.
- Else continue comparison till the end of the array.
- If reached the end without a match, print Not Found
