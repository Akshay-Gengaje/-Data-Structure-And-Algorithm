/*
Linear Search is a sequential search algorithm.
    - In Linear Search, weâ€™ll have to traverse the array comparing the elements consecutively one after the other
    Until the target value is found.
    - Linear Search has a high time complexity making at most n comparison
    - Hence, it is only suitable to search for elements in a small and unsorted list of elements

    | Time Complexity  | O(n)
    | Best Case	       | O(1)
    | Worst Case	   | O(n)
    | Space Complexity | O(1)
    | Avg. Comparisons | (n+1)/2
