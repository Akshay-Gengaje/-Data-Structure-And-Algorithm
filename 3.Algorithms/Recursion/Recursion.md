# Recursion Algorithms

Recursion is a technique in computer programming where a function calls itself repeatedly until the problem is solved. Recursion is widely used in solving problems that involve repetitive structures and operations. Recursive algorithms have two main components: a base case and a recursive case. The base case is the stopping condition, and the recursive case is where the function calls itself until the base case is reached.

## How Recursion Works

When a function calls itself, a new instance of the function is created, and the parameters are passed to it. The new instance of the function executes the same code as the original instance, but with different parameters. This process continues until the base case is reached, at which point the function returns a value to the calling function.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion

Recursion has several advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages of recursion include:

- It can simplify the code and make it more readable.
- It can solve problems that are difficult to solve using iterative algorithms.
- It can reduce the time and space complexity of the program.

Some of the disadvantages of recursion include:

- It can be less efficient than iterative algorithms because of the overhead of function calls.
- It can lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth is too high.
- It can be difficult to debug because of the multiple instances of the function.

## Examples of Recursive Algorithms

1. **Factorial Function**

The factorial function is a classic example of a recursive algorithm. It calculates the factorial of a number by multiplying it by all the positive integers less than it. The base case of the factorial function is when the number is 0 or 1.

```
function factorial(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}
```

2. **Fibonacci Sequence**

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The base case of the Fibonacci sequence is when the number is 0 or 1.

```
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
    return n;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, recursion is a powerful technique in computer programming that involves a function calling itself repeatedly until the problem is solved. Recursive algorithms have a base case and a recursive case, and they are widely used in solving problems that involve repetitive structures and operations. While recursion can simplify the code and solve complex problems, it can also be less efficient than iterative algorithms and can lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth is too high.
