Memoization is an optimization technique used in dynamic programming to reduce redundant computations in recursive algorithms. It involves storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This process helps to avoid redundant calculations by keeping a record (memo) of previously computed results.

In the context of dynamic programming, memoization is commonly applied to problems that can be solved by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems. When solving a subproblem, the result is stored in a data structure (often a table or a dictionary) associated with the specific inputs to that subproblem. The next time the same subproblem needs to be solved, the algorithm first checks whether the solution is already available in the memoization table. If it is, the stored result is returned instead of recomputing it.

Here's a simple example in Python to illustrate memoization using a recursive function for calculating the Fibonacci sequence:

```python
def fibonacci(n, memo={}):
    if n <= 1:
        return n

    # Check if the result is already memoized
    if n not in memo:
        # If not, calculate the Fibonacci number and store it in the memoization table
        memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)

    return memo[n]

# Example usage
result = fibonacci(5)
print(result)  # Output: 5
```

In this example, the `memo` dictionary is used to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers, preventing redundant calculations for the same input `n`. Memoization can significantly improve the efficiency of recursive algorithms by avoiding unnecessary recalculations and reducing time complexity.
