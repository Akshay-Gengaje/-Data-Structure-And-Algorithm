Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant computations. This technique is particularly useful for optimization problems, where the goal is to find the best solution among a set of possible solutions.

The key idea behind dynamic programming is to solve a problem by solving its smaller subproblems and using the solutions to those subproblems to construct the solution to the original problem. This approach is often more efficient than a naive recursive solution that repeatedly solves the same subproblems.

There are two main approaches to dynamic programming:

1. **Top-down approach (Memoization):** In this approach, the problem is solved recursively, but the solutions to subproblems are stored in a table or memoized to avoid redundant computations. This helps in avoiding recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.

2. **Bottom-up approach (Tabulation):** In this approach, the problem is solved iteratively, starting from the simplest subproblems and building up to the original problem. The solutions to subproblems are stored in a table, and the final solution is computed by combining these solutions.

Dynamic programming is commonly used in various areas, including computer science, optimization, artificial intelligence, and economics. Some well-known problems that can be solved using dynamic programming include the knapsack problem, the longest common subsequence problem, and the Fibonacci sequence, among others. The dynamic programming approach often leads to more efficient algorithms compared to naive recursive solutions.
