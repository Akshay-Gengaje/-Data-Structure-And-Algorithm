A tree is a widely used data structure in computer science that represents a hierarchical structure. It consists of nodes connected by edges, where each node contains data and may have zero or more child nodes. The topmost node in a tree is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves.

Here are some key terms associated with tree structures:

1. **Node:** A fundamental part of a tree that contains data and may have zero or more child nodes.

2. **Root:** The topmost node in a tree, from which all other nodes are descended. There is exactly one root node in a tree.

3. **Parent:** A node in a tree that has one or more child nodes.

4. **Child:** A node in a tree that has a parent node.

5. **Leaf:** A node in a tree that has no children, meaning it is at the bottom of the hierarchy.

6. **Siblings:** Nodes that share the same parent in a tree.

7. **Depth:** The level or distance of a node from the root. The root is at depth 0, its children are at depth 1, and so on.

8. **Height:** The length of the longest path from a node to a leaf. The height of the tree is the height of the root.

9. **Subtree:** A tree formed by a node and all its descendants.

10. **Binary Tree:** A special type of tree in which each node has at most two children, usually referred to as the left child and the right child.

11. **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree in which the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key. This property ensures efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements.

Trees are used in various applications, such as representing hierarchical relationships, organizing data in file systems, implementing symbol tables in compilers, and serving as the foundation for more complex data structures like heaps and expression trees.
