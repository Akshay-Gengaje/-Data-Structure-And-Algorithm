# Data Structure

A **data structure** is a method of organizing, managing, and storing data in a computer. It is chosen for efficient access to data. It's not only used for organizing the data but also for processing, retrieving, and storing data.

Data structures can be classified into different types:

## Linear Data Structure

Data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements. Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.

## Static Data Structure

It has a fixed memory size. An example of this data structure is an array.

## Dynamic Data Structure

The size is not fixed and can be updated during the runtime. Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.

## Non-linear Data Structure

Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly. Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.

Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers.
