**Advantages**

    - Ease of insertion and deletion.
    - Dynamic Size

**Disadvantages**

    - We have to search elements linearly, and can’t do random access
    - We can’t do efficient searches like binary search
    - Extra space for pointers is needed
    - Linked lists are not cache friendly as arrays are stored in contigious format they can be cached easily
    - Loss of data threat is there, if we lose one pointer location the rest of linked list can’t be accessed.
