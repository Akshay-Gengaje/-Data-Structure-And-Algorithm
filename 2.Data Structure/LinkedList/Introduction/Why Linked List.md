# Why Linked List?

Linked lists are used in a variety of applications because they have a number of advantages over other data structures, such as arrays.

- **Dynamic memory allocation:** Linked lists do not require a fixed amount of memory to be allocated at the time of creation. Instead, memory is allocated dynamically as needed. This makes linked lists ideal for applications where the size of the data structure is not known in advance, or where the data structure needs to be able to grow and shrink over time.
- **Efficient insertion and deletion:** Insertions and deletions can be performed efficiently in linked lists, as they do not require any shifting of data. This makes linked lists ideal for applications where the data structure needs to be frequently updated.
- **Versatility:** Linked lists can be used to implement a variety of other data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash tables. This makes linked lists a powerful tool for developing complex software applications.

Here are some specific examples of how linked lists are used in real-world applications:

- **Web browsers:** Web browsers use linked lists to store the history of pages visited by the user. This allows the user to easily navigate back and forth through their history.
- **Music players:** Music players use linked lists to store the playlist of songs. This allows the user to easily play and navigate through the playlist.
- **Operating systems:** Operating systems use linked lists to manage the memory allocated to different processes. This allows the operating system to efficiently allocate and manage memory resources.
- **Compilers:** Compilers use linked lists to store the symbol table, which is a data structure that maps identifiers to their corresponding values. This allows the compiler to efficiently keep track of all of the identifiers used in a program.
- **Databases:** Databases use linked lists to implement linked lists and other data structures, such as B-trees. This allows databases to efficiently store and manage large amounts of data.

Overall, linked lists are a versatile and powerful data structure that is used in a wide variety of applications.
