# Array

An **array** is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations[^1^][1]. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together[^1^][1]. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array)[^1^][1].

## Properties of Array

- Each element in an array is of the same data type and carries the same size[^2^][2].
- Elements in the array are stored at contiguous memory locations from which the first element is stored at the smallest memory location[^2^][2].
- Elements of the array can be randomly accessed since we can calculate the address of each element of the array with the given base address and the size of the data element[^2^][2].

## Why are arrays required?

Arrays are useful because[^2^][2]:

- Sorting and searching a value in an array is easier.
- Arrays are best to process multiple values quickly and easily.
- Arrays are good for storing multiple values in a single variable.

## Memory allocation of an array

As stated above, all the data elements of an array are stored at contiguous locations in the main memory. The name of the array represents the base address or the address of the first element in the main memory. Each element of the array is represented by proper indexing[^2^][2].
